## 📖 PROJECT OVERVIEW
This project analyzes a medical dataset to identify key factors influencing Caesarian section (CS) deliveries among women. A logistic regression model is built to predict the likelihood of a CS delivery based on health and delivery characteristics.

## 🔍 DESCRIPTION
Caesarian deliveries, while life-saving, are often linked to maternal health risks when unnecessarily conducted. Predicting CS likelihood based on patient data can guide health providers in personalized care planning.

## ❓ PROBLEM STATEMENT
Many CS procedures are influenced by factors like maternal age, delivery type, blood pressure, and heart health. Without data-driven insight, it’s difficult to distinguish medically necessary CS from avoidable ones, potentially leading to overuse or under-preparedness.

## 🎯 PROJECT OBJECTIVE
This project aims to:

✅ Analyze medical and delivery-related features influencing CS delivery

✅ Build a logistic regression model to predict CS occurrence

✅ Identify significant predictors using statistical tests

✅ Support better maternal healthcare decisions with data

## 🔍 KEY AREAS ANALYZED
📌 Age distribution and risk

📌 CS vs. Delivery type, blood pressure

📌 Correlation between variables

📌 Significant predictors via logistic regression

## 📊 DATA SOURCE
The data was obtained from kaggle website
